# Explanation for using QoS 2:
'''
In MQTT, QoS 2 guarantees that each message is delivered exactly once. 
This is critical for cases where message duplication must be avoided, 
such as when sending sensor data or other important updates. By using 
QoS 2 in receive_data_once, we ensure the MQTT broker will keep trying 
to deliver the message until it is confirmed by the client, which is 
ideal for applications that require high data reliability.
